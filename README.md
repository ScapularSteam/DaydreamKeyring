Creating 3D-printed keyrings can be a great way to make extra pieces of swag on a budget!

## Cost Breakdown

Each keyring uses 2.51g of filament, and so from a 1kg roll, you can make 398 keyrings. 
If you assume a cost of £15/roll, this comes out to £0.038 / keyring in filament costs. 
The 5mm diameter hole in the key ring makes it perfect for hanging from a small metal carabiner clip. 
These can be purchased for £5.20 for a bag of 100 clips on AliExpress. This results in a cost of £0.052p / carabiner. 
This makes the final raw material £0.09, or 9p.

These costings do not, however, factor in shipping costs or electricity usage. The amount of filament required to make each keyring will also vary depending on printer settings. 

Assuming a turnout of ~4000, as was the case for Scrapyard, you could give one keyring to every participant for a cost of £360.

Assuming you want to make no more than 100 keyrings, the cost to an event organiser is £20.20. The cost can likely be brought down if you already own the filament to make the keyrings.

## What about laser cutting?

If you'd like to make a laser-cut keyring, or would like to engrave the Daydream logo onto items, I've included a DXF file in the repo too.

## I want to modify the file!

The Fusion file is provided in case you would like to alter the design! For Scrapyard London, I created a version of the keychain with the word London written below the main text, so perhaps this might be something you would want to consider.
